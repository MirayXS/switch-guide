::: warning

**Have you partitioned your microSD card?**

This page assumes that you've followed our guide to partition your microSD card for a Linux setup. If you didn't do so yet, please follow [this page](../user_guide/all/partitioning_sd_syscfw).

::: tip
[Install a Linux Distribution](https://wiki.switchroot.org/wiki/linux/linux-distributions)
:::

- **Note:** You can skip the partitioning mentioned in the Switchroot documentation. You already did this during the guide and do *not* have to do so again.

If you already have Linux fully installed, do not follow this guide, as your current installation would be erased.

**Looking for Arch?**

Unfortunately, L4S Arch Linux is deprecated following an xorg ABI change that breaks compatibility with the Tegra210 BSP.
