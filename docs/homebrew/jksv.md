# Save Management

## JKSV

For save data management, [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game save data.

The documentation on this page was made in collaboration with [JK](https://github.com/J-D-K).

## Backing up save data using JKSV

### Instructions:

1. Launch JKSV from the homebrew menu.

    - **Note:** If you wish to back up all save data at once, simply press `Y` while hovering over your user in the sidebar, then proceed by holding `A`.
1. Hover over your desired game and press `A` to select it.
1. Press `A` again to create a new save backup
1. Enter a name for the save data folder containing the save data and press `+` or `OK`.
1. Wait for it to finish backing up your save data.

## Restoring save data using JKSV

### Instructions:

1. Launch JKSV from the homebrew menu.
1. Select your Switch user on the left side with the `A` button.
1. Hover over your desired game and press `A` to select it.
1. Hover over the save data folder containing the save data you want to restore and press `Y`.
1. Hold the `A` button to restore the save data, keep holding it until it's finished.

## Setting up remote save data backups (Google Drive & WebDAV)

    ![](img/jksv/oauth_client_id.png)
    ![](img/jksv/oauth_client_id_type3.png)
    ![](img/jksv/oauth_client_id_type1.png)

1. Click on `Create` and you will end up at the final window for this step, download the JSON file containing the client info for JKSV.

    - **Note:** Google will not allow you to download this file again after this point!
    :::

    ![](img/jksv/oauth_client_created2.png)

1. Rename the downloaded file to `client_secret.json` and store it somewhere safe.

### 4. Add yourself as a test user

1. Go to `Navigation menu` → `APIs & Services` → `OAuth consent screen` → `Audience`.

1. Click `+ Add users` and add your email.

    ![](img/jksv/test_users.png)

### **5. Copying the JSON file to your microSD card**

Copy the `client_secret.json` file to: `sd:/config/JKSV`.

### **6. Launching JKSV**

The next time JKSV starts with an internet connection, it will guide you to complete the login process by navigating to `https://google.com/device` and filling in the code mentioned in the middle of your screen in JKSV.

The next time JKSV starts with an internet connection, it will give you a notification near the bottom of your screen stating `Successfully signed in to Google Drive!` if your configuration file was set up correctly. You can now back up and store your save data backups on your WebDAV server by pressing `Zr` on any save data backup!

---

### **6. (OPTIONAL BONUS STEP!)**

1. Make a secure backup of `client_secret.json` from your microSD card **after logging in with JKSV**.
    - This is recommended if you plan to share saves between multiple consoles due to Google’s OAuth scope policies.

:::: tab WebDAV

JKSV features a functionality that allows you to back up your save data from the JKSV homebrew app directly to a WebDAV server. The setup for this feature is detailed below.

Please note that this feature requires you to either sign up for a WebDAV server provider or selfhost your own WebDAV server on your local network.

### 1. Creating and applying the WebDAV configuration file

1. Create a file named `webdav.json` and paste the following contents in it:
    ```
    {
        "origin": "https://example.com",
        "basepath": "path/to/JKSV",
        "username": "optional",
        "password": "optional"
    }
    ```

1. Create a folder named `JKSV` on your WebDAV server.
    - **Note:** The folder name doesn't *have* to be called `JKSV`. For the sake of this guide, `JKSV` was used for consistency purposes. 

1. Fill in the `origin`, `basepath`, `username` and `password` fields, the base path is case sensitive and beginning/trailing slashes should be left out in the `origin` and `basepath` fields. Keep the information below in mind.
    - The `origin` field should **always** contain the host portion of the WebDAV server you're connecting to.
    - The `basepath` field should either contain the absolute path to the location of the WebDAV endpoint + folder created in the previous step or you can use an aliased folder.
    - The `username` and `password` fields should contain your credentials you use to authenticate with your WebDAV server. These lines can be left out/removed entirely if you do not have authentication set up for your WebDAV server.

    If you need WebDAV configuration examples, unfold the section below.

    ::: details WebDAV configuration examples {closed}

    **Example 1:**

    Your WebDAV endpoint is hosted on a local server with IP address `192.168.1.100` with the WebDAV endpoint running at `192.168.1.100/webdav`, on which you created the `JKSV` folder. In this example you do not use any authentication.

    ```
    {
        "origin": "http://192.168.1.100",
        "basepath": "webdav/JKSV",
    }
    ```

    ---

    **Example 2:**

    Your WebDAV endpoint is hosted on a WebDAV server provider at `https://app.koofr.net/dav/Koofr`, on which you created the `JKSV` folder. In this example you *do* use authentication.

    ```
    {
        "origin": "https://app.koofr.net",
        "basepath": "dav/Koofr/JKSV",
        "username": "<Koofr email address>",
        "password": "<Generated WebDAV password>"
    }
    ```

    ---

    **Example 3:**

    Your WebDAV endpoint is hosted on a local server with IP address `192.168.1.100` with the WebDAV endpoint running at `192.168.1.100/webdav`, but you have an alias for `192.168.1.100/webdav/JKSV` set up so that your endpoint is available on `192.168.1.100/JKSV`. In this example you *do* use authentication.

    ```
    {
        "origin": "http://192.168.1.100",
        "basepath": "JKSV",
        "username": "<WebDAV username>",
        "password": "<WebDAV password>"
    }
    ```
    
    :::

### **2. Copying the JSON file to your microSD card**

Copy the `webdav.json` file to `sd:/config/JKSV`.

### 3. **Launching JKSV**

The next time JKSV starts with an internet connection, it will give you a notification near the bottom of your screen stating `WebDav successfully started!` if your configuration file was set up correctly. 

You can now back up and store your save data backups on your WebDAV server by pressing `Zr` on any save data backup!
